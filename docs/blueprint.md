# **App Name**: SafeSphere

## Core Features:

- Real-time disaster detection: Disaster Detection: Use official APIs (e.g., IMD, NDMA, USGS), social media (Twitter/X, Instagram), and user reports to identify disasters. The tool should employ NLP to filter relevant news and AI to detect fake alerts.
- Real-time alerts: Real-Time Alerts: Provide immediate push notifications with location, disaster type, and severity. Display affected areas on a map with color-coded danger levels.
- Emergency resources: Emergency Resources: One-tap SOS to call nearest rescue/medical services and a finder for nearby relief camps and hospitals.
- First aid guide: First Aid Guide: Provide step-by-step instructions for different emergencies, directly accessible within the app.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Black (#000000) for a sense of security and reliability.
- Secondary color: A vibrant blue (#3399CC) evoking trust and safety.
- Accent color: A yellow (#FFDA63) to indicate actionable items and calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif known for its modern, neutral look, suitable for both headlines and body text, ensuring readability and clarity in critical information dissemination.
- Use clear and universally recognizable icons for disaster types, alert levels, and emergency resources. Ensure high contrast against background colors for quick identification.
- Design a clean, intuitive layout with a clear hierarchy of information. Prioritize essential alerts and resources for immediate access. Implement a map-centric interface for visualizing disaster zones and safe routes.
- Employ subtle animations for alert notifications and map updates to provide real-time feedback without overwhelming the user. Avoid overly flashy or distracting animations that could impede usability.
